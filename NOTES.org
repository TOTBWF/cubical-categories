#+TITLE: Notes

This file serves as a working notebook of all design choices,
experiments, and observations that I have made while writing this.

* Equality
  The biggest deviation from other category theory libraries
  (most notably =agda-categories=) is that we use paths
  when defining laws rather than parameterizing
  by some notion of morphism equality.

  This would seem to present some problems when dealing with weaker
  constructs (bicategories, etc), but I suspect that Higher Inductive
  Types will make short work of them. For example, consider the
  bicategory case.
