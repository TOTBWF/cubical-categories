#+TITLE:Cubical Categories

This library formalizes Category Theory inside of Cubical Agda.
This lets us avoid issues of morphism equality, and hopefully
lets us implement things like strict categories is a much easier way.

* Origins
  This library was born out of https://github.com/agda/agda-categories, and takes
  quite a bit of inspiration from it.
